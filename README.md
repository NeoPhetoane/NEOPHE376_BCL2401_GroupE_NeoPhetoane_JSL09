# [JSL09] Submission: Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension

**Overview**

This project involves the development of a Chrome extension designed to provide real-time information to users. The displayed data includes the current time, location-specific weather details, updates on cryptocurrencies, and attribution information about the background image. Multiple Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are integrated to fetch the required data.

**Reflections**

**Areas of Mastery**

API Integration: The project has facilitated a deep understanding of discovering, interpreting, and accessing various APIs.
DOM Manipulation: Proficiency has been gained in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), especially using the innerHTML property and identifying HTML elements via their unique IDs.

**Challenges Faced**
Asynchronous Programming: Implementing asynchronous operations correctly was challenging, particularly when using the await keyword and the try...catch construct.
Network Latency: Delays in retrieving data from external APIs due to network latency issues were recurrent.

**Areas for Improvement**
User Interface Design: Improvements could be made by customizing the presented information to suit user preferences, such as including additional data sources like Billboard charts or news updates.

Error Handling: Error handling strategies need refinement, involving informative error messages and robust mechanisms for handling failed API requests.
**Overall Learning Experience**
The project provided valuable insights into working with APIs, including integration, data retrieval, and error handling mechanisms. Additionally, it deepened the understanding of asynchronous programming concepts and highlighted the importance of network resilience in web development.
